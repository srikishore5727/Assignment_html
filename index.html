<h1>SRI KISHORE S</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is <B>Sri Kishore</B>, and I'd like to share a bit about myself. I did my schooling at <b>CKT Matriculation Higher Secondary School</b>. My hobbies are Listening to music, playing outdoor games and going for walks which makes me happy. My strength is I am a quick learner, self-motivated person and I will never trust anyone easily. My weakness is I am naturally introverted and tend to be a bit on the shy side. I am eager to explore the world and learn from every experience.</p>
